### Figma to Code [#figma_to_code]

By installing VigmaRN [**Figma-plugin**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1260477949715606742/vigma-rn), you can export your Figma design into code. See more about [Figma to Code](/more/figma_to_code)

[^1]: It relies on React-Native-Web to render the component. So it's not a 100% accurate representation of how it will look on a mobile devices. But it should be close enough for most cases.
[^2]: Only simple storybook is supported. No knobs, no actions. The storybook file should have the same basename as the component file. For example, if you have a component file `PersonCard.tsx`, the storybook file should be `PersonCard.stories.tsx`
