## Features

### Screenshot to Code (New!) [#screenshot_to_code]

Drop an image, and get the code for it. (Read more about [Screenshot to Code](/screenshot_to_code))

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/ScreenshotToCode.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />
<br />

### Real-time Design to Code [#real_time_design_to_code]

Draw UI, and see the code generated in VS-Code.

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/PersonCard.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />

Of course, you can always work from the code side, in the traditional way.

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/CodeToUi.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />
<br />

### Code Pointing [#code_pointing]

Double click an element from the Layer Explorer, and the corresponding code will be highlighted.

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/CodePointing.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />
<br />

### UI Pointing [#ui_pointing]

Place your cursor on any Jsx element, and the corresponding element will be marked in the UI.

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/UiPointing.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />
<br />

### Independent Component Rendering [#independent_component_rendering]

Components can be rendered independently, with Storybook (CSF 2.0 & 3.0) support.[^2]

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/storybookSupport.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />
<br />

### Storybook Generation [#storybook_generation]

If you don't have a storybook, AI will generate one for you.

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/StorybookGeneration.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
<br />
<br />

### Figma to Code [#figma_to_code]

By installing VigmaRN [**Figma-plugin**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1260477949715606742/vigma-rn), you can export your Figma design into code. See more about [Figma to Code](/more/figma_to_code)

[^1]: It relies on React-Native-Web to render the component. So it's not a 100% accurate representation of how it will look on a mobile devices. But it should be close enough for most cases.
[^2]: Only simple storybook is supported. No knobs, no actions. The storybook file should have the same basename as the component file. For example, if you have a component file `PersonCard.tsx`, the storybook file should be `PersonCard.stories.tsx`
