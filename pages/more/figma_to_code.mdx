# Figma To Code

## How to start

1. Install [**Figma-plugin**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1260477949715606742/vigma-rn)
2. open your figma file
3. go to Dev mode by clicking right top corner toggle button
4. select VigmaRN plugin
5. copy and paste your code

## Features

- generate RN code
- Extract component, if it was defined in Figma
- Replace with the component you want
- Display the component in the GUI window
- Delete the component in one click, if not necessary

## Limitation

- If the code is longer than a certain length(~2000 lines), you'll probably have some performance issues.

## Demo

<video width='100%' controls muted loop>
  <source src='/videos/figmaPlugin.webm' type='video/webm' />
</video>
