# Getting Started

## Installation

In VS-Code, look for the extension Vigma RN and install it.

## Project Setup

Vigma RN was developed the latest version of Expo with expo-router and typescript in mind. So we highly recommend you to start with a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app --template typescript
```

While your existing project may work, we can't guarantee it will work as expected.

## Figma plugin

If you want to implement the figma design into React Native, you can use our [**Figma-plugin**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1260477949715606742/vigma-rn).
Checkout [**this page**](/more/figma_to_code) for more information.
