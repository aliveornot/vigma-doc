## Project Setup

Vigma RN was developed the latest version of Expo with expo-router and typescript in mind. So we highly recommend you to start with a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app --template typescript
```

While your existing project may work, we can't guarantee it will work as expected.
