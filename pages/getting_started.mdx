# Getting Started

It's now in closed beta. You can fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/yoVn3v3kf9ysmHBr5) to get early access.

## Installation

In VS-Code, look for the extension Vigma RN and install it.

## Project Setup

Vigma RN was developed the latest version of Expo with expo-router and typescript in mind. So we highly recommend you to start with a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx create-vigma-app
```

It's based on default Expo typescript template, but with little modification to illustrate how to use Vigma RN. While your existing project may work, we can't guarantee it will work as expected.

## Editing a component

Open a `.tsx` file in a react-native project, and you'll see two little blue icons in the top right corner of your editor:
![icons](/images/gettingStarted/icons.png)

The first one (in the shape of a cursor) will open current file in Vigma RN editor. The second one (in the shape of +) will create a new component file, and start editing it rightaway.

## Figma plugin

If you want to implement the figma design into React Native, you can use our [**Figma-plugin**](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1260477949715606742/vigma-rn).
