# How it works under the hood

This is how the extension works under the hood. It's not necessary to read this to use the extension, but it might be interesting to some.

### The extension operates by:

1. Creating a temporary copy of the current file.
2. Integrating this copy with a GUI editor app.
3. Bundling the file using rs-pack, a new webpack-compatible tool.
4. Running the bundle with rspack-dev-server.

### When you make a change inside the GUI editor:

1. Direct modifications are made to the HTML DOM (not Virtual DOM).
2. The source code in the text editor is updated to reflect these changes, without directly saving them to the file.

The main challenge in developing this extension was ensuring synchronization between the GUI changes and the code updates, and **it's far from being perfect even now**.
If you notice any differences between the GUI and the code, please [report](https://github.com/aliveornot/vigma-doc/issues/new).
