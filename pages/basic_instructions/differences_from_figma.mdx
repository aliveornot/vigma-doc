# Crucial Differences from Figma

Due to the nature of how `flexBox` works, there are two crucial differences between Figma and Vigna RN.

1. All frames are auto-layout (in RN, all visible elements are `display: flex`)
2. Even NOT-absolute frames can be moved arbitrarily (in RN, `position:relative` elements can have `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` properties)

- FYI, you're gonna see something like this when a `position:absolute` frame is selected:
