# Default Wrapper Frame

- A component is always rendered in an outer frame. (You can think of it as an hypothetical screen, the `<body>` tag, or a parent Element.) This outermost frame, which we call `ROI frame`, always has `flexDirection: column` (We plan to make this customizable in the future.)
