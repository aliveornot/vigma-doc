# Supported React Native elements

Only (part of) the fundamental building blocks of React Native are supported to work in GUI, namely:

- `View`
- `ImageBackground`
- `TouchableOpacity`
  <br />
- `Text`
  <br />
- `Image`
  <br />
- `TextInput`
  <br />
- `ScrollView`
- `FlatList`

  The list will be expanded in the future. (`LinearGradient` is probably the next one to be added.)
