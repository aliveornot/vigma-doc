# Basic Instructions

It is very close to Figma, but has two crucial differences:

- All frames are auto-layout (in RN, all visible elements are `display: flex`)
- Even NOT-absolute frames can be moved (in RN, `position:relative` elements can have `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` properties)

- in contrast, you're gonna see something like this in absolute frames:
